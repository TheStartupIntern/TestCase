# Contributor Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This repository is dedicated to maintaining well-structured and high-quality test cases. Please follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and clarity.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

Test cases are organized as follows:

1. **`content/`** â€“ The main directory where all test cases are stored, categorized by project type (e.g., `Web Apps`).
2. **Project Type Folder (e.g., `Web Apps/`)** â€“ Contains subfolders for different types of testing.
3. **Test Type Folder (e.g., `Functional Testing/`, `Security Testing/`, `Usability Testing/`)** â€“ Groups test cases by their testing category.
4. **Test Suite Folder (e.g., `Navigation/`, `Form Validation/`, `Search Functionality/`)** â€“ Contains related test cases.
5. **Test Case Files** â€“ Each test case is stored as a separate `.md` file inside the relevant suite folder.
