# Verifying Navigation on a Slow Network
Verify that the homepage loads correctly when accessed via the URL on a slow network   

#### **Preconditions:**  
- A user has access to a slow internet connection.  

#### **Test Steps:**  
1. Open a web browser.  
2. Input the application's homepage URL in the address bar (e.g., `https://www.example.com`) on a slow network.  
3. Press **Enter** and observe the page loading on a slow network.  
4. Observe the behavior of the application. 

#### **Expected Result:**  
- The homepage loads successfully within an acceptable time or shows a meaningful loading indicator.
- Page load time should be within an acceptable limit (e.g., <3 seconds).  
- No error messages such as **"404 Not Found"**, **"500 Internal Server Error"**, or connection issues should appear.

#### **Postconditions:**  
- The user should be able to load the page despite the slow speed.

#### **Test Priority:**  
Medium  

#### **Status:**  
Pass/Fail (to be determined after execution)
