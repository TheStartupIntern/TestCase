Pre-condition:
The user is on the form page.
The form contains at least one required field (e.g., Name, Email).
The user is not logged in (if the form requires login).

Test Steps:
Open the form page.
Leave one or more required fields empty (e.g., leave the 'Name' or 'Email' field empty).
Click the Submit button.

Expected Result:
The form should not be submitted.
Error messages should appear near the empty required fields (e.g., "This field is required" or "Please enter a valid email address").
The submit button should be disabled or should remain active until all required fields are filled correctly.

Post-condition:
The form remains unsubmitted, and the user is shown error messages for the empty required fields.

Test Priority: High

Status: Not Executed / Passed / Failed
Notes:
Test Priority: "High" because missing required fields is a basic validation that must always work correctly to prevent incomplete submissions.
Status: The status should be updated after executing the test.
This test case is designed to verify a basic, essential part of form validation, ensuring that required fields cannot be skipped and proper error handling is in place.
