# Brute Force Attack Prevention
Verify that the system prevents brute force attacks by limiting login attempts.

#### **Preconditions:**  
- A stable internet connection is available.
- The user has access to a supported web browser.

#### **Test Steps:**  
1. Open a web browser. 
2. Navigate to the application's login page.
3. Attempt to log in repeatedly with different combinations of usernames and passwords.
4. Observe the behavior of the application.

#### **Expected Result:**  
- The system detects multiple failed attempts and implements a lockout mechanism (e.g., CAPTCHA or temporary account lockout).
- No unauthorized access is granted.

#### **Postconditions:**  
- User can retry login only after the temporary lock or the CAPTCHA is passed.
- The system remains protected against brute-force attacks.

#### **Test Priority:**  
High

#### **Status:**  
Pass/Fail (to be determined after execution)
